#Solution to problem 4: Red-eye correction

###Problem
The program corrects color of red eye.
This file implements the core part of sorting some red-eye index.

###Key ideas
* the function your_sort implements a radix sort algorithm
* the kernel function predictor and flip implements simple map patterns
* the kernel funciton scanEx implements the Blellock scan algorithm
* the kernel function merge implements scattering

###Performance
The code runs ~32ms on the course testing platform.
